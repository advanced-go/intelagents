// I think this agent needs to be shared for updates to controllers and also events such as restart.
// Anything affecting a specific agent, needs to be routed to the appropriate host via sharding
// Sharding will improve data consistency and reduce latency
// What does this agent need to work
// 1. Observation data
//    - Access Log
//    - Experience
//    - Inference
//    - Action
// 2. Guidance data
//    - Global processing schedule
//    - Dependency processing schedule
//    - Controller Configuration
