State Management
----------------
What is state?
 1. All data in external data stores.
 2. Application constants for durations, exclusive of context timeouts



We are really talking all agent state, which includes data stored in an external data store, but
durations used for observation activation


How to manage interaction with a backing data store over the following priorities:
  1. Cost
     a. Database calls - explicit monetary cost
     b. Stale data

Data retrieval strategies:
  1. Continuous polling.
     a. Data consistency - high
     b. Data cost - high
  2. Scheduled update.
     a. Data consistency - low
     b. Data cost - low

How do we define and achieve the appropriate level of data consistency?
  1. Rate of change - can this be managed, system generated or customer generated
  2. Time of change - can this be reasonably constrained?
